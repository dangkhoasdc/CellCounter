# Proposed Method
[Updating]

# Requirements

1. numpy >= 1.9 
2. opencv >= 2.4.10
3. skimage >= 0.12
4. matplotlib >= 1.4.3
5. pymorph >= 0.96

# Usage

Run `python program_nolearing.py` for more detail about using this program. 

## Examples

`python program_nolearing.py -d training.txt -v`: count all images which are located in file `training.txt` and visualize the result.
`python program_nolearing.py -d training.txt -o result.txt`: count all images which are located in file `training.txt` and write the result to file `result.txt`
